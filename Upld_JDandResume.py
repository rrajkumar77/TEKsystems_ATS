 - A list of top skills provided as a comma-separated string (e.g., "SQL, Python, Pyspark") passed as additional input.
 - A resume extracted from a file, provided as text content, detailing the candidate's skills, experience, projects, and qualifications.
2. Process: For each skill in the provided top_skills list:
 - Check if the skill is explicitly mentioned or implied in the resume (e.g., through job titles, tools used, projects, certifications, or keywords).
 - Estimate the years of experience for each skill by analyzing the duration of relevant roles, projects, or education in the resume. If no specific duration is provided, estimate based on context (e.g., "recent graduate" = 0-1 year, "senior role" = 3+ years).
 - Identify any relevant projects, roles, or experiences from the resume that demonstrate the skill.
3. Output: Present the results in a clear, structured table format with the following columns:
 - Skill: The specific skill from the top_skills list (use exact wording from the input).
 - Match Status: "Yes" if the skill is present in the resume (explicitly or implicitly), otherwise "No".
 - Relevant Projects: List projects, roles, or experiences from the resume that demonstrate the skill (e.g., "Data Analysis Project"). If none, write "None".
 - Years of Experience: Estimate total years related to the skill (e.g., "2 years"). If no experience, write "0 years".
4. Additional Notes:
 - Use only the skills provided in the top_skills input; do not prompt for additional input or reference the job description (JD).
 - Handle resume text noise (e.g., file extraction artifacts) by focusing on key terms and context.
 - If experience duration is unclear, make reasonable assumptions (e.g., "1 year" for junior roles, "3 years" for mid-level).
